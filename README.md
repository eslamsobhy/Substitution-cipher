# Substitution-cipher
This application is used for encrypting / decrypting any plaintext / ciphertext using the substitution cipher. Which is secure against the brute force attack since it is not convenient to design a program to get through all the permutations to get the Subs. Table (26! permutations). 
The program provide a great feature that allow the user to enter the Subs. Table.
The user will get through some validations to make sure that the 26 letters string (Subs. Table) is valid to be used. When it comes to enter the input string to be encrypted or decrypted, the program is expecting the user to enter alphabetic characters. So any other characters will be ignored by the program like they are not there (i.e. spaces, any special characters, etc.). The result appears without any spaces even if the user entered the input string with spaces; so that no third party can detect how many words are there.
